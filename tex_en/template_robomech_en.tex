\subsection{Manuscript requirements [Subsection Title; 9pt, Bold font, Left-aligned]}%-----------
\begin{itemize}
	\item Paper size: A4 (210 $\times$ 297 mm)
	\item Margins: Top and Bottom = 25 mm, Left and Right (title area) = 25 mm, Left and Right (two-column area) = 15 mm, Column separation = 6 mm.
	\item Font settings: Refer to the \reftab{tbl: table1}.
	\item Resolution of figures: High resolution image that are more than 300 dpi.
	\item Captions of figures and tables: “Fig.\# Title of the figure” and “Table \# Title of the table.”
    \item Axis names: Do not use just variables but show specific words and units for representing the axes.
	\item Equations: Describe equations at the center of line and specify equation numbers with a right alignment. In texts, show the equation numbers like “\refeqn{eqn: eq1}.”
	\begin{equation}
		M\ddot{r}_{str1} + F_{frk} = Mg
		\label{eqn: eq1}
	\end{equation}

	\item Unit systems: Use the SI units.
	\item When you refer literature in the texts,  insert the reference number after the words or sentences referred (For example, the study\cite{Shinjuku98}). If the referred word is a subject or an object, do not use the reference number alone but describe like “The study\cite{Shinjuku98} reports ... .”
	\item Prefix $\bigcirc$ to the author's name who make a presentation.
	\item Your manuscript should be converted to a PDF.  Please submit only the PDF. Follow the instruction on the website to submit the manuscript. 
	\item[] 
	\item[*] Note that the file size of the PDF must be less than 2 MB, and the page length is 2--4 pages. 
	\item[*] Do not include the Paper ID, the conference name, and page numbers. 
\end{itemize}
